https://roadmap.sh/backend/project-ideas

## Description
This is a RESTful API designed to power a personal blogging platform. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog articles. The API supports filtering articles by publishing date or tags and provides endpoints for managing individual articles by ID.

## Features
- **Retrieve a list of articles** with optional filters (e.g., date, tags)
- **Retrieve a single article** by its ID
- **Create a new article**
- **Update an existing article** by ID
- **Delete an article** by ID

## Tech Stack
- **Backend Framework:** Fastify (Node.js) / Django (Python) / Ruby on Rails / Sinatra (Ruby)
- **Database:** MongoDB (NoSQL) or MySQL (SQL)
- **Authentication:** (Optional) JWT for securing endpoints
- **API Design:** RESTful architecture

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
- Node.js (if using Fastify) / Python (if using Django) / Ruby (if using Rails or Sinatra)
- MongoDB or MySQL installed and configured

As a recommendation for techstack, you could use Fastify as the main backend framework if you’re going with Node, or perhaps Django for Python or even Ruby on Rails or Sinatra for Ruby. As for your database, you could use MongoDB if you want to try NoSQL or MySQL if you’re looking to get started with relational databases first.

I Use Express, Node.js and MongoDB.
